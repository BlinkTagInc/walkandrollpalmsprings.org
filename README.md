# Walk and Roll Palm Springs
A mobile-first website that:
* integrates with an API to pull up a list of destinations (such as Visit Palm Springs or Yelp)
* allows those destinations to be categorized (such as "eat/play/stay")
* calculates walk/bike/transit directions between a location and any of those destinations
* calculates calories burned and pounds of CO2 emissions saved by making that trip without a car
* allows neighborhoods to compete for most calories/CO2 burned/saved for trips in their area
